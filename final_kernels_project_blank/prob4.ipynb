The basic idea behind the kernel is that two strings with more common substrings will be more similar. What is a substring? A substring is any contiguous sequence of characters within a string. The kernel function the **p-spectrum kernel** expresses this idea. $k(s_1, s_2)$ counts all size $p$ substrings that are present in both the string $s_1$ and the string $s_2$.   \n",
